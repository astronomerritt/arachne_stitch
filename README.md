# arachne

This will one day be a package for creating cross-stitch patterns from images!

I created this project so I could get better at OOP and, eventually, packaging.

## to-do
* create output class and functionality
* implement algorithms to improve patterns: smoothing, colour-clustering
* find a way to speed up floss map generation, nested for-loops are evil
* grey-scale and monocolour modes
* can I have the user specify desired number of colours?

## the name
Arachne was a weaver from ancient Greek mythology who challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest. Perhaps surpisingly, she won handily, but since she'd chosen to depict images of the gods' infidelities and misdemeanours in her flawless and beautiful tapestry, Athena clobbered her with the shuttle and turned her into a spider. Greek gods love an ironic punishment.

I doubt any cross-stitch patterns made here will draw down the wrath of the gods, but you never know.
