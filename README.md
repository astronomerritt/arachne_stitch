# arachne

This will one day be a package for creating cross-stitch patterns from images!

I created this project so I could get better at OOP and, eventually, packaging.

## to-do
* create output class and functionality
* implement algorithms to improve patterns: smoothing, colour-clustering
* find a way to speed up floss map generation
* grey-scale and monocolour modes
* can I have the user specify desired number of colours?
